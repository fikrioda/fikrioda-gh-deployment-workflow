# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to deploy an `index.html` file to GitHub Pages whenever it changes.

## Features

- Automatically deploys `index.html` to GitHub Pages.
- Workflow triggers only when `index.html` is modified.

## How It Works

- The repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
- On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow checks for changes to `index.html`.
- If changes are detected, it deploys the file to GitHub Pages.
